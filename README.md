# TP2 - AEDS3
## Introduction
Project developed during the discipline "Algoritmos e Estruturas de Dados III", in DCC/UFMG.

The goal of the project was to write an external sorting algorithm in C, that also could create a reverse index out of the input files (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index).

The problem was solved using an implementation of the K-way merge algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-way_merge_algorithm). 

## Build

The project can be built on any linux machine using the Makefile available. This repository also features a little bash script to run all the example tests given on the project assignment.
